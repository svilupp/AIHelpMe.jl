For example, you can use it with the `sum` function to compute the sum of an array that contains `missing` values, like in the expression `sum(skipmissing([1, 2, missing]))`, which returns `3`. The `skipmissing()` function can also be used in DataFrames to compute values across columns that may contain `missing` entries."
