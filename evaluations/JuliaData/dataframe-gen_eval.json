The `CategoricalPool{V,R,C}` type keeps track of the levels of type `V` and associates them with an integer reference code of type `R` (for internal use). It offers methods to add new levels, and efficiently get the integer index corresponding to a level and vice-versa. Whether the values of `CategoricalArray` are ordered or not is defined by an `ordered` field of the pool.\nDo note that `CategoricalPool` levels are semi-mutable: it is only allowed to add new levels, but never to remove or reorder existing ones. This ensures existing `CategoricalValue` objects remain valid and always point to the same level as when they were created. Therefore, `CategoricalArray` s create a new pool each time some of their levels are removed or reordered.\nThis happens when calling `levels!` , but also when assigning a `CategoricalValue` via `setindex!` , `push!` , `append!` , `copy!` or `copyto!` (as new levels may be added to the front to preserve relative order of both source and destination levels).","2. In particular, `U` allows expressing that `CategoricalArray{T, N}` inherits from `AbstractArray{Union{C, U}, N}` (which is equivalent to `AbstractArray{C, N}` for arrays which do not support missing values, and to `AbstractArray{Union{C, Missing}, N}` for those which support them).\nThe `CategoricalPool` type is designed to limit the need to go over all elements of the vector, either for reading or for writing. This is why unused levels are not dropped automatically (this would force checking all elements on every modification or keeping a counts table), but only when `droplevels!` is called.\n`levels` is a (very fast) O(1) operation since it merely returns the (ordered) vector of levels without accessing the data at all.","3. Scalar operations between `CategoricalValue` objects or between a `CategoricalValue` and a `CategoricalArray` generally require checking whether pools are equal or whether one is a superset of the other.\nIn order to make these operations efficient, `CategoricalPool` stores a pointer to the last encountered equal pool in the `equalto` field, and a pointer to the last encountered strict superset pool in `subsetof` field. The hash of the levels is computed the first time it is needed and stored in the `hash` field.\nThese optimizations mean that when looping over values in an array, the cost of comparing pools only has to be paid once.","4.

Table is actually a Julia array type, where each element (row) is a `NamedTuple` . In particular: Externally. a `Table` presents itself as an array of named tuples. That is, each row of the table is represented as one of Julia's new `NamedTuple` s, which are easy to use and highly efficient. In subtype notation, `Table <: AbstractArray{<:NamedTuple}` .\nInternally, a `Table` stores a (named) tuple of arrays, and is a convenient structure for column-based storage of tabular data. Thus, manipulating data as a `Table` is as easy as manipulating arrays and named tuples - which is something Julia was specifically designed to make simple, efficient and  fun .\n`Table` s (and their columns) may be an `AbstractArray` of any dimensionality. This lets you take advantage of Julia's powerful array functionality, such as multidimensional broadcasting. Each column must be an array of the same dimensionality and size of the other columns.","2. ```julia julia> t = Table(name = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"], age = [25, 42, 37])\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     age\n   ┌─────────────\n 1 │ Alice    25\n 2 │ Bob      42\n 3 │ Charlie  37```\nA `Table` behaves as a Julia array that contains named tuples for each row. Each row is a single element - you should consider the above as a one-dimensional container with three elements, rather than as a two-dimensional \"matrix\" of six cells. Another name for a collection of named tuples is a \"relation\", and `Table` s are useful for performing  relational algebra .\nYou can access elements (rows) exactly like any other Julia array. ```julia julia> t[1]\n(name = \"Alice\", age = 25)\n\njulia> t[1:2]\nTable with 2 columns and 2 rows:\n     name   age\n   ┌───────────\n 1 │ Alice  25\n 2 │ Bob    42``` A element (row) of the table can be updated with the usual array syntax.","3.

You can speed up data analysis tasks with acceleration indices, by using the  AcceleratedArrays.jl package.","4.

Packages should consider whether it makes sense to propagate missing values when defining new functions, and define methods appropriately if this is the case. Passing a `missing` value to a function which does not have a method accepting arguments of type `Missing` throws a  `MethodError` , just like for any other type.\nFunctions that do not propagate `missing` values can be made to do so by wrapping them in the `passmissing` function provided by the  Missings.jl package. For example, `f(x)` becomes `passmissing(f)(x)` .","2. `missing` values  propagate automatically when passed to standard mathematical operators and functions. For these functions, uncertainty about the value of one of the operands induces uncertainty about the result. In practice, this means a math operation involving a `missing` value generally returns `missing` :\n```julia-repl julia> missing + 1\nmissing\n\njulia> \"a\" * missing\nmissing\n\njulia> abs(missing)\nmissing``` Since `missing` is a normal Julia object, this propagation rule only works for functions which have opted in to implement this behavior. This can be achieved by: adding a specific method defined for arguments of type `Missing` ,\naccepting arguments of this type, and passing them to functions which propagate them (like standard math operators).","3. ```julia julia> Table(name = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"], age = [25, missing, 37])\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     age\n   ┌─────────────────\n 1 │ Alice    25\n 2 │ Bob      missing\n 3 │ Charlie  37```\nIn Julia, `missing` values propagate safely where this is appropriate. For example, `missing + 1` is also `missing` - if we didn't know the value before, we still don't after adding `1` . This makes working with missing data simple and pain-free, and Julia's optimizing compiler also makes it extremely fast.","4. Some languages have several types to represent missing values.

Logical (or boolean) operators  `|` ,  `&` and  `xor` are another special case since they only propagate `missing` values when it is logically required.

Control flow operators including  `if` ,  `while` and the  ternary operator `x ? y : z` do not allow for missing values. This is because of the uncertainty about whether the actual value would be `true` or `false` if we could observe it. This implies we do not know how the program should behave.\nIn this case, a  `TypeError` is thrown as soon as a `missing` value is encountered in this context:","5. For the same reason, contrary to logical operators presented above, the short-circuiting boolean operators  `&&` and  `||` do not allow for `missing` values in situations where the value of the operand determines whether the next operand is evaluated or not. For example:\n```julia-repl julia> missing || false\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Missing) used in boolean context\n\njulia> missing && false\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Missing) used in boolean context\n\njulia> true && missing && false\nERROR: TypeError: non-boolean (Missing) used in boolean context```\nIn contrast, there is no error thrown when the result can be determined without the `missing` values. This is the case when the code short-circuits before evaluating the `missing` operand, and when the `missing` operand is the last one: ```julia-repl julia> true && missing\nmissing\n\njulia> false && missing\nfalse```"],"answer":"The short-circuiting boolean operators `&&` and `||` do not allow for `missing` values because the evaluation of these operators relies on determining the truth value of each operand to decide whether the next operand should be evaluated. Since `missing` represents an indeterminate value (neither `true` nor `false`), it introduces uncertainty about whether to proceed with the evaluation, leading to a `TypeError`.

Arrays containing missing values can be created like other arrays: ```julia-repl julia> [1, missing]\n2-element Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}:\n 1\n  missing```\nAs this example shows, the element type of such arrays is `Union{Missing, T}` , with `T` the type of the non-missing values. This reflects the fact that array entries can be either of type `T` (here, `Int64` ) or of type `Missing` .","2. This kind of array uses an efficient memory storage equivalent to an `Array{T}` holding the actual values combined with an `Array{UInt8}` indicating the type of the entry (i.e. whether it is `Missing` or `T` ).\nArrays allowing for missing values can be constructed with the standard syntax. Use `Array{Union{Missing, T}}(missing, dims)` to create arrays filled with missing values: ```julia-repl julia> Array{Union{Missing, String}}(missing, 2, 3)\n2×3 Matrix{Union{Missing, String}}:\n missing  missing  missing\n missing  missing  missing``` Note\nUsing `undef` or `similar` may currently give an array filled with `missing` , but this is not the correct way to obtain such an array.

Objects created by calling `skipmissing` on an array can be indexed using indices from the parent array.

The  `Tables.Schema` of a `AbstractColumns` object can be queried via `Tables.schema(columns)` , which may return `nothing` if the schema is unknown.\nColumn names can always be queried by calling `Tables.columnnames(columns)` , and individual columns can be accessed by calling `Tables.getcolumn(columns, i::Int )` or `Tables.getcolumn(columns, nm::Symbol)` with a column index or name, respectively.\nNote that if `x` is an object in which columns are stored as vectors, the check that these vectors use 1-based indexing is not performed (it should be ensured when `x` is constructed). source Given these two powerful data access methods, let's walk through real, albeit somewhat simplified versions of how packages actually use these methods."],"answer":"Column names in Julia can be obtained using the `names` function.

A standardized framework for handling this sort of computation is described in the paper \"  The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis \", written by Hadley Wickham.\nThe DataFrames package supports the split-apply-combine strategy through the `groupby` function that creates a `GroupedDataFrame` , followed by `combine` , `select` / `select!` or `transform` / `transform!` .\nAll operations described in this section of the manual are supported both for `AbstractDataFrame` (when split and combine steps are skipped) and `GroupedDataFrame` . Technically, `AbstractDataFrame` is just considered as being grouped on no columns (meaning it has a single group, or zero groups if it is empty)."],"answer":"Split-apply-combine can be used with `@transform` in a data frame to add new variables by performing operations by group. For example, you can de-mean the total hours of sleep of an animal relative to other animals in the same genus by grouping the data frame by a column (e.g., `:order`), and then transforming the data within each group.

This is where the “dot” operator `.` , also known as  broadcasting , comes in. ```julia logarithm.(my_example_matrix)``` ```julia 3×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.0      0.693147  1.09861\n 1.38629  3.73767   1.79176\n 2.83321  2.77259   2.70805```\nThe dot operator in Julia is extremely versatile.
