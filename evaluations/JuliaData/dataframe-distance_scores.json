It is the type created by array-literal syntax, such as `[1, 2, 3]` . You can create an array of a given element type by prepending the type - for example, `Float64[1, 2, 3]` is equivalent to `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` .\nYou can create an empty vector of a given type `T` with `T[]` or the explicit constructor `Vector{T}()` .

Most of the time, especially when dealing with tabular data, we are using either one- or two-dimensional arrays. They are both `Array` types for Julia. But, we can use the handy aliases `Vector` and `Matrix` for clear and concise syntax.\nHow do we  construct an array? In this section, we start by constructing arrays in a low-level way. This can be necessary to write high performing code in some situations. However, in most situations, this is not necessary, and we can safely use more convenient methods to create arrays. These more convenient methods will be described later in this section.\nThe low-level constructor for Julia arrays is the  default constructor . It accepts the element type as the type parameter inside the `{}` brackets and inside the constructor you’ll pass the element type followed by the desired dimensions. It is common to initialize vector and matrices with undefined elements by using the `undef` argument for type."]},{"average_distance":0.3478753541076487,"minimum_distance":0.0,"question":"What are the potential limitations of using `Table` with a large number of columns in Julia?","source":"https://typedtables.juliadata.org/stable/man/table - Table/Comparison with other packages/DataFrame","distance_scores":[0.0,0.45325779036827196,0.4475920679886686,0.4192634560906515,0.4192634560906515],"context":"Conversely, the Julia compiler spends effort tracking the names and types of all the columns of the table.
