There exists an  example of a simulation of an N-body system at absolutely custom potential. Here is shown how to create custom acceleration functions using tools of NBodySimulator. First, it is necessary to create a structure for parameters for the custom potential. ```julia struct CustomPotentialParameters <: PotentialParameters\n    a::AbstractFloat\nend```\nNext, the acceleration function for the potential is required. The custom potential defined here creates a force acting on all the particles, proportionate to their masses. The first argument of the function determines the potential for which the acceleration should be calculated in this method.\n```julia import NBodySimulator.get_accelerating_function\nfunction get_accelerating_function(p::CustomPotentialParameters,\n                                   simulation::NBodySimulation)\n    ms = get_masses(simulation.system)\n    (dv, u, v, t, i) -> begin\n        custom_accel = SVector(0.0, 0.0, p.a)\n        dv .= custom_accel * ms[i]\n    end\nend```"],"answer":"The repulsive force between two particles based on the given potential energy function \\(U(r)\\) can be derived from the gradient of \\(U(r)\\).
