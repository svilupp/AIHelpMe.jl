To support R-style programming, `TidierData.jl` is implemented using macros. This is because macros are able to \"capture\" the code before executing it, which allows the package to support R-like \"tidy expressions\" that would otherwise not be considered valid Julia code. TidierData.jl currently supports the following top-level macros: Top-level macros: `@glimpse()`\n`@select()` and `@distinct()` `@rename()` and `@rename_with()` `@mutate()` and `@transmute()` `@summarize()` and `@summarise()` `@filter()` `@slice()` , `@slice_sample()` , `@slice_min()` , `@slice_max()` , `@slice_head()` , and `@slice_tail()` `@group_by()` and `@ungroup()` `@arrange()` `@relocate()` `@pull()` `@count()` and `@tally()`"],"answer":"The `@nest` macro in the `TidierData` package is used to nest data frames, which means it groups the data by one or more columns and nests the remaining columns into a sub-data frame within each group. This can be useful for handling hierarchical or nested data structures.\n\nUsage:\n```julia\n@nest(dataframe, group_columns...) # group_columns are the columns to group by\n```\n\nFor example, to nest a data frame by columns `col1` and `col2`, you would use:\n```julia\n@nest(df, col1, col2)\n```\n\nThis will transform `df` such that each group of `col1` and `col2` values has its own sub-data frame containing the remaining columns.","completeness":4,"consistency":4},{"question":"How is a line plot created in Julia using ggplot and DataFrame with specific labels and theme?","clarity":5,"relevance":5,"helpfulness":5,"rationale":null,"final_rating":5.0,"context":["1.

For calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean) by groups, or for plotting purposes, DataFrames often need to be converted to their longer form. For this, we can use `@pivot_longer` . First, let's start with a \"wide\" DataFrame. ```julia df_wide   =   DataFrame ( id   =   [ 1 ,   2 ],   A   =   [ 1 ,   3 ],   B   =   [ 2 ,   4 ])``` 2×3 DataFrame Row id A\nNow, let's transform this wide dataset into the longer form.

The `names_to` and `values_to` arguments are optional, and if not provided, they will default to \"variable\" and \"value\", respectively.\nWe can recreate the original long dataset by doing the following. Multiple columns must be provided using selection syntax or a selection helper.

If you're happy with the R tidyverse, then there's no imminent reason to switch to using Tidier.jl. While DataFrames.jl (the package on which TidierData.jl depends)  is faster than R's dplyr and tidyr on benchmarks , there are other faster backends in R that allow for the use of tidyverse syntax with better speed (e.g., dtplyr, tidytable, tidypolars).\nThe primary reason to consider using Tidier.jl is the value proposition of using Julia itself. Julia has many similarities to R (e.g., interactive coding in a console, functional style, multiple dispatch, dynamic data types), but unlike R, Julia is automatically compiled (to LLVM) before it runs.\nThis means that certain compiler optimations, which are normally only possible in more verbose languages like C/C++ become available to Julia. There are a number of situations in R where the end-user is able to write fast R code as a direct result of C++ being used on the backend (e.g., through the use of the Rcpp package)."],"answer":"The provided Context does not specify Tidier.jl's design philosophy regarding the use of scalar or tuple for multiple value arguments.","completeness":1,"consistency":1},{"question":"What is the main goal of the Tidier.jl package and how does it differ from other Julia meta-packages for DataFrame manipulation?","clarity":5,"relevance":5,"helpfulness":5,"rationale":null,"final_rating":5.0,"context":["1.
