One great feature of Makie is that it uses `Observables` (or `Nodes` as a Makie-specific alias), which make it easy to write visualizations that can be updated dynamically with new data. An `Observable` is a container object which notifies all its listeners whenever its content changes. Put simply, using `Observables` , if your input data changes your plots change as well.\nPlot objects usually have a collection of attributes, which are observables. If you change them, the plots update and the scene will reflect that. Let's try to change the marker size of the scatter we created last.","2. Interaction and animations in Makie are handled using  `Observables.jl` . An `Observable` is a container object whose stored value you can update interactively.

Makie offers a sophisticated referencing system to share attributes across the Scene in your plot. This is great for interaction, animations and saving resources – also if the backend decides to put data on the GPU you might even share those in GPU memory.\nInteraction and animations in Makie are handled by using  `Observables` . An \"observable\", called `Node` in Makie, is a structure that can have its value updated interactively. Interaction, animations and more are done using `Node` s and event triggers.\nIn this page we overview how the `Node` s pipeline works, how event-triggering works, and we give an introduction to the existing \"atomic\" functions for interaction. Examples that use interaction can be found in the Examples/ `interaction` page (see  Example Gallery as well). Have a peek at  Animation for some more information once you're done with this.","5.

But it takes too much space vertically, and there is a large gap on the right.\nLet's deal with the gap on the right first. It's the hole that was left by the legend, and it's even bigger now because it gets an equal share of space with the two axes, now that there is no legend shrinking the column width to its own size. We can remove empty cells in a layout by calling `trim!` on it: ```julia trim!(layout)```\nThis is much better already! But the legend still takes too much space vertically. The reason for that is the default `tellheight` setting of the legend. It's set to `false` , which essentially means that it can compute its own height, but doesn't tell the layout about it.
