By default this is true for `AbstractMatrix` , and for `AbstractSciMLOperator` s it matches the choice of the operator definition.

https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLStyle/stable/ - SciML Style Guide for Julia/Overarching Dogmas of the SciML Style/Closures should be avoided whenever possible,"Closures can cause accidental type instabilities that are difficult to track down and debug; in the long run it saves time to always program defensively and avoid writing closures in the first place, even when a particular closure would not have been problematic.
