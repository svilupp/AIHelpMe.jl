In this specific case, the delayed system is defined by the following differential equations:

\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &= - \gamma y(t) + \delta x(t) y(t),

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling is a typical sampler to use, as it tends to be fairly good at converging in a efficient manner.

We use the Gelman, Rubin, and Brooks Diagnostic to check whether our chains have converged.

How does the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) extend the mapping provided by Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (pPCA)?,5,5,5,,4.8,"['1.

Indeed, pPCA is basically equivalent to running the GPLVM model with an automatic relevance determination (ARD) linear kernel.

While pPCA uses linear mappings to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, GPLVM employs Gaussian Processes to non-linearize these mappings, enabling more complex and flexible relationships between the high-dimensional data and its lower-dimensional embedding. This transformation allows for a more nuanced and accurate representation of the latent structure in the data.",4,5

What makes Turing sampling methods compatible with models defined by the `@model` macro?,5,5,5,,5.0,"['1. The function `sample` is part of the AbstractMCMC interface. As explained in the  interface guide , building a sampling method that can be used by `sample` consists in overloading the structs and functions in `AbstractMCMC` . The interface guide also gives a standalone example of their implementation,  `AdvancedMH.jl` .\nTuring sampling methods (most of which are written  here ) also implement `AbstractMCMC` . Turing defines a particular architecture for `AbstractMCMC` implementations, that enables working with models defined by the `@model` macro, and uses DynamicPPL as a backend.\nThe goal of this page is to describe this architecture, and how you would go about implementing your own sampling method in Turing, using Importance Sampling as an example. I don’t go into all the details: for instance, I don’t address selectors or parallelism.', '2. The following terminology will be used in this section: `D` : observed data variables conditioned upon in the posterior, `P` : parameter variables distributed according to the prior distributions, these will also be referred to as random variables, `Model` : a fully defined probabilistic model with input data\n`Turing` ’s `@model` macro rewrites the user-provided function definition such that it can be used to instantiate a `Model` by passing in the observed data `D` . The following are the main jobs of the `@model` macro: Parse `~` and `.~` lines, e.g. `y .~ Normal.(c*x, 1.0)` Figure out if a variable belongs to the data `D` and or to the parameters `P`\nEnable the handling of missing data variables in `D` when defining a `Model` and treating them as parameter variables in `P` instead Enable the tracking of random variables using the data structures `VarName` and `VarInfo` Change `~` / `.~` lines with a variable in `P` on the LHS to a call to `tilde_assume` or `dot_tilde_assume`', '3. We implement our sampler in the  AbstractMCMC.jl interface, which just means that our sampler is a subtype of `AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler` and we implement the MCMC transition in `AbstractMCMC.step` .\nPoints 1 and 2 makes it so our sampler can be used with a wide range of model implementations, amongst them being models implemented in both Turing.jl and Stan. This gives you, the inference implementer, a large collection of models to test your inference method on, in addition to allowing users of Turing.jl and Stan to try out your inference method with minimal effort.', '4. Documentation   Using Turing - Modelling Syntax and Interface   External Samplers', '5. Turing implements a sampling interface (hosted at  AbstractMCMC ) that is intended to provide a common framework for Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. The interface presents several structures and functions that one needs to overload in order to implement an interface-compatible sampler. This guide will demonstrate how to implement the interface without Turing.']","Turing sampling methods are compatible with models defined by the `@model` macro because the macro rewrites the user-provided function definition to instantiate a `Model` by passing in the observed data `D`. The `@model` macro performs several key tasks that facilitate this compatibility:
1. It parses `~` and `.~` lines to understand the distribution assignments.
2. It identifies whether a variable belongs to the data `D` or to the parameters `P`.
3. It enables the handling of missing data variables in `D`, treating them as parameter variables in `P` when defining a model.
4. It tracks random variables using the data structures `VarName` and `VarInfo`.
5. It replaces lines involving variables in `P` on the left-hand side with calls to `tilde_assume` or `dot_tilde_assume`.

This architecture allows Turing's sampling methods, which implement the `AbstractMCMC` interface, to work seamlessly with models defined using the `@model` macro.",5,5
