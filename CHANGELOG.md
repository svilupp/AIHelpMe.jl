## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Preliminary) Knowledge packs available for Julia docs (`:julia`), Tidier ecosystem (`:tidier`), Makie ecosystem (`:makie`). Load with `load_index!(:julia)` or several with `load_index!([:julia, :tidier])`.

### Changed
- Bumped up PromptingTools to v0.20 (brings new RAG capabilities, pretty-printing, etc.)
- Changed default model to be GPT-4 Turbo to improve answer quality

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong initiation of `CONV_HISTORY` and other globals that led to UndefVarError. Moved several globals to `const Ref{}` pattern to ensure type stability, but it means that from now it always needs to be dereferenced with `[]` (eg, `MAIN_INDEX[]` instead of `MAIN_INDEX`).
