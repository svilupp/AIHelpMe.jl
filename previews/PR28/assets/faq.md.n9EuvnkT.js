No, embedding a comprehensive set of documentation is surprisingly cost-effective. Embedding around 170 modules, including all standard libraries and more, costs approximately 8 cents and takes less than 30 seconds. To save you money, we have already embedded the Julia standard libraries and made them available for download via Artifacts. We expect that any further knowledge base extensions should be at most a few cents (see <a href="/svilupp.github.io/AIHelpMe.jl/previews/PR28/faq#extending-the-knowledge-base">Extending the Knowledge Base</a>).</p><h2 id="How-much-does-it-cost-to-ask-a-question?" tabindex="-1">How much does it cost to ask a question? <a class="header-anchor" href="#How-much-does-it-cost-to-ask-a-question?" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How much does it cost to ask a question? {#How-much-does-it-cost-to-ask-a-question?}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Each query incurs only a fraction of a cent, depending on the length and chosen model.</p><h2 id="Can-I-use-the-Cohere-Trial-API-Key-for-commercial-projects?" tabindex="-1">Can I use the Cohere Trial API Key for commercial projects? <a class="header-anchor" href="#Can-I-use-the-Cohere-Trial-API-Key-for-commercial-projects?" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I use the Cohere Trial API Key for commercial projects? {#Can-I-use-the-Cohere-Trial-API-Key-for-commercial-projects?}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>No, a trial key is only for testing purposes.
