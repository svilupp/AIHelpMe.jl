<h1> Why AIHelpMe.jl? </h1>

AI models, while powerful, often produce inaccurate or outdated information, known as "hallucinations," particularly with smaller models that lack specific domain knowledge. 

AIHelpMe addresses these challenges by incorporating "knowledge packs" filled with preprocessed, up-to-date Julia information. This ensures that you receive not only faster but also more reliable and contextually accurate coding assistance. 

With AIHelpMe, you benefit from enhanced AI reliability tailored specifically to Juliaâ€™s unique environment, leading to better, more informed coding decisions.


<h2> Getting Started </h2>

To install AIHelpMe, use the Julia package manager and the address of the repository (it's not yet registered):

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/svilupp/AIHelpMe.jl")
```

You'll need to have the OpenAI API key with charged credit (see the [How to Obtain API Keys](@ref)).

```julia
using AIHelpMe
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable!
aihelp"how to create tuples in julia?"

# You can even specify which model you want, eg, for simple and fast answers use "gpt3t" = GPT-3.5 Turbo
aihelp"how to create tuples in julia?"gpt3t
```

Or use the full form `aihelp()` and understand better not just the answer, but the sources used to produce it
```julia
using AIHelpMe: last_result, pprint

result=aihelp("how to create tuples in julia?", return_all=true)
pprint(result)

# you can achieve the same with aihelp"" macros, by simply calling the "last_result"
pprint(last_result())
```


For more information, see the [Quick Start Guide](@ref) section.
